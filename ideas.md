[22:38, 11/6/2018] Scott: Game name idea: Welcome to flavourtown
storyboard:
1. you are a new beer company on the block, select your first beer name
2. select 2 flavours from the list of 20 to combine them into your trademark beer of choice
3. select what style of container you want (stubby can, pint can, bottle, coke bottle style etc.)
4. sell your beer for profit £££ 

There are 4 metrics the game will use to determine if a beer is successful or not:
1. The flavour combo (each flavour has a list of values and if 2 flavours are a good match for eachother then the 'profit' multiplier is increased, the opposite is true if you put together a bad combination
2. Some beer flavours specify that they work better with cans or bottle etc. this will have an effect on the profit multiplier
3.  You can select where you want to sell the beer (hipster bar, local shop, high class bar, local pub etc.) each flavour and container type will have a matching location to sell, stubby cans for example would go well in the hipster bar but not in the high class bar
4. Potentially User can specify a price out of 3 options (£, ££ or £££) and if this is a match for the profit multiplier then the profit multiplier is increased

Each batch brews 100 units of that beer and the batch profit is determined by the above profit multiplier

1. select beer name
2. flavour selector
3. container selector (potentially add in label creator but thats out of scope for now i assume)
4. sell your beer screen
5. view your beers and how well they are doing
